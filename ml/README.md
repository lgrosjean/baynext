# Machine Learning Pipelines

This folder will be used to create training and inference pipelines for machine learning workflows. The pipelines are designed to be containerized with Docker and deployed as Cloud Run jobs.

## Goals

- Develop scalable training and inference solutions
- Ensure reproducibility and portability using Docker
- Enable deployment on Google Cloud Run

## Structure

- `training/` — Training pipeline code and configuration
- `inference/` — Inference pipeline code and configuration
- `Dockerfile` — Container setup for pipelines
- `cloudrun/` — Deployment scripts and documentation

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Build the Docker image for your pipeline.
3. Deploy the container to Cloud Run.

Further documentation will be added as development progresses.
